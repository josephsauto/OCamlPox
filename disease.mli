(** 
   This module represents a disease that may spread throughout a list of 
   countries. The disease has a name and starting country initialized
   by the player upon play. It handles loading of data from JSON as well.

(** The abstract type of values representing countries. [total_population] 
    represents the total population of the country. An individual can either be 
    part of [population_healthy] or [population_inf], but not both. Their union
    is disjoint. [contains_disease] determines whether the country currently is
    infected, and the [global_score] represents the score associated with each
    country. [neighbors] represents the neighbors to the country. *)

(** The abstract type of values representing diseases. The [disease_name] and

type t

(** Raised when the country name is unknown. *)
exception UnknownCountry of string

(** Raised when a string is of length 0 *)
exception Empty

(** Raised when a string does not match a particular keyword *)
exception Malformed


(** [init_disease countries name country intensity] picks a [country] from 
    [countries], and initializes it as the starting country for the disease, 
    and introduces an infected populataion.It also names the disease with 
    [name, and provides it a value associated with [intensity].
    Raises: [UnknownCountry] if [country] is not in [countries], 
    and [Malformed] if [intensity] is not a correct keyword. *)
